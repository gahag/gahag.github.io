#+begin_verse
In the beginning, we were
In this very place, we met
For each other, we fell
In the moonlight, we kissed
In this very bed, we laid
Deep inside, we're still the same
But otherwise, we've changed
In the same ways, we walked
In both our pasts, we stumbled
In the soil, our faces
To move on, we stood up
In the very end, we stand
There's no going back
And no way is forward
